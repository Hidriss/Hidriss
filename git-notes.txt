>>>>>>>>>>>>What is a repository?
A repo is a place where you store "things".

>>>>>>>>>>>What is git?
Git is a version control system (VCS) and collaboration tool. In short, it's a tool that manages file history/versions (e.g. source code files). It keeps track of changes and provides tools to share content.


>>>>>>>>>What is gitlab/github?
Github/Gitlab are online git hosting services. Hosting services can also supply additional tools that make collaboration for source code even easier; each host may have different service. Capitalism, amirite?

>>>>>>>>>>>>What is a distributed VCS vs a central VCS?

a CENTRAL VCS uses a central location to store all source code, data, and records. There are some issues with this, however. What happens if you lose internet? or the website goes down? You don't have acces to your data anymore.

A DISTRIBUTED VCS creates a COPY of the source code and each user's machine. That way, if you lose internet you can still work or see what the most recent changes you "pulled" are. And if you make changes to your LOCAL version of the code base, then you "push" those changes to an online host so that your team members may "pull" your changes.


git comamnds we've used on day one:

git status		check the current state of git's file tracking
git config		is used to modify git's configurations
git clone		copies all files from a remote repository onto your local machine
git add .		add files from your working directory into your staging directory
git add [file1] [file2], etc		adding specific files to your staging directory
git commit -m "my message"		create a new commit version from your staging directory
git push		sends your LOCAL changes to the REMOTE repository
git pull		is git fetch+ git merge
	git fetch	go to the remote git (gitlab) and retreive any changes it has
				but doesn't merge these changes with your local code
	git merge	take one branch's content and merge it into the current branch's code
git checkout [branchname]	changes the current branch to another branch
git checkout -b [branchname]	changes current branch IF it exists, if not a new branch will be created
git log			lists all commit versions
git revert		reverts an existing commit version
git stash		removes working directory changes (can be retrieved later)
git remote -v		lists your fetch and push URLs
git branch		is used for specific commands for a branch


IF YOU WANT TO MERGE THE BATCH MASTER BRANCH WITH YOUR PERSONAL BATCH BRANCH:

git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout [your branch]
git merge master
